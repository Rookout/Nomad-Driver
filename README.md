[Rookout](https://rookout.com) is a disruptive developer solution for Cloud Native debugging and live-data collection.
Rookoutâ€™s Non-Breaking Breakpoints let you collect any type of data on the fly with no extra coding, redeployments, or restarts. 

The `rookout` Nomad driver is used to execute Java applications packaged into a Java Jar file and automatically add the Rookout SDK to them.

More info about the Rookout SDK is available in the [Rookout docs](https://docs.rookout.com).

**Documentation on how to use this driver is available [here](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/drivers/external/rookout)**
